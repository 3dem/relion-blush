# Blush Refinement

This repository contains code for running Blush regularization in RELION-5. 
This project is designed to work in conjunction with tools for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) three-dimensional reconstruction. 
For specific functionalities, we leverage the capabilities of RELION, an open-source, highly flexible and high-performance solution for cryo-EM.
